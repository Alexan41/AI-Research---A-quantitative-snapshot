                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved rapidly in recent years. 
                    It is a fact highlighted by 
                    <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fd6a895e-d296-4dab-9aab-15a1559ea054">
                        Hannah and George (2025)</a> who has put 
                    forward the explosive adoption and investment as venture funding in 
                    AI-first apps reached $8.2 billion in 2024, or otherwise the rapid 
                    revenue growth of AI app companies like Cursor, Perplexity, Synthesia 
                    and ElevenLabs posting up to $200 million in annual recurring revenue 
                    within just a few years.

                    AI has become today such a powerful and diversified tool that all 
                    components of the society benefits from it. In particular, 93% of 
                    college students across U.S. have used AI at least once or twice for 
                    school-related purposes <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2025/06/25students-ai-use-on-the-rise-survey-finds.aspx">
                        (Rhea K., 2025).</a> From drafting essays and
                    tackling STEM problems to preparing for interviews and managing mental 
                    health, AI has become a staple in campuses across the nation. 
                    But with convenience comes complexity: concerns around academic 
                    integrity, creativity, overreliance, and fair access demand a balanced 
                    understanding.

                <h2>a. Academic assistance and study aid</h2>
                <p>
                    From the Chegg report:
                </p>
                <p>
                    67% use AI for summarizing materials, creating study guides, or explaining 
                    complex topics; 42% rely on it for career development; 42% for personal 
                    organization
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A global Digital Education Council survey reported top uses:
                </p>
                <p>
                    69% for information search; 42% for grammar checking; 33% for document 
                    summarization; 28% for paraphrasing; 24% for drafting.
                </p>

                <h2>b. Wiriting, drafting and editing</h2>
                <p>
                    Grammarly and ChatGPT lead adoption: ChatGPT is used by 66% of students; 
                    Grammarly and Microsoft Copilot each by ~**25%** 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students rely on AI to produce rough drafts, polish prose, and bypass writer’s 
                    block.
                </p>

                <h2>c. STEM problems</h2>
                <p>
                    A study of computing students found ChatGPT became as common as online search 
                    by 2024; only 6.3% never used ChatGPT, down from 34.1% in 2023
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another study in STEM education concluded many students “just input problems 
                    for AI to generate solutions,” skipping cognitive work
                </p>

                <h2>d. Personalized tutoring</h2>
                <p>
                    Macmillan Learning’s “AI Tutor” saw users spending 6.3 minutes per session, 
                    mostly during late evening hours (18:00–03:00).
                </p>
                <p>
                    41% of instructors noted improved student confidence or exam performance, 
                    and 44% of student users reported better problem-solving confidence.
                </p>
                
                <h2>e. Career and life management</h2>
                <p>
                    Chegg found 43% of students use AI for résumé, cover letter, and interview 
                    prep; 42% for managing deadlines and schedules

                <h2>a. Faculty concerns on cheating</h2>
                <p>
                    A Vox/TNY adviser notes widespread student “cheating” via AI in 
                    humanities courses, prompting calls to integrate rather than ban 
                    AI
                </p>
                <p>
                    A New York Magazine deep dive highlights generative AI tools being used 
                    “to complete academic assignments, frequently crossing into outright 
                    cheating”
                </p>

                <h2>b. Institutions scrambling</h2>
                <p>
                    A Times article reports no clear consensus on AI-use policies—some 
                    ban it, others encourage it, many ignore it—and many faculty feel 
                    detection tools are inadequate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A New Yorker analysis flagged reduced creativity and homogenized 
                    thinking among AI-assisted students  
                </p>

                <h2>c. Skill erosion and cognitive risks</h2>
                <p>
                    MIT experiments found ChatGPT users exhibited reduced brain activity 
                    and working memory compared to peers using search engines
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wikipedia cites psychological findings linking AI reliance with 
                    lower academic self-esteem and learned helplessness

                <h2>a. Faculty engagement with AI</h2>
                <p>
                    Inside Higher Ed reports that 33% of U.S. college instructors now 
                    use generative AI; 80% leverage ChatGPT for course content and 63% 
                    for assessments
                </p>
                <p>
                    67% of faculty use AI to grade or give feedback; 17% say it reduced their 
                    workload, mainly in course prep (61%) and research (52%)  
                </p>

                <h2>b. Emerging policies and curriculum design</h2>
                <p>
                    Some humanities departments, per Vox, are shifting from banning AI to designing 
                    assignments intentionally using AI, fostering critical reflection
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Harvard survey showed students want more AI-related courses—over 50% 
                    expressed concern about job prospects and inequality
                </p>

                <h2>c. Evolving integrity detection</h2>
                <p>
                    While tools like Turnitin have AI detectors, false positives remain common, 
                    particularly against ESL and neurodiverse students

                <p>
                    Per Macmillan’s “AI Tutor” study: 67% use it only as needed; 29% sometimes overuse it
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yale and Harvard students report conflicts: AI aids them, but they worry it 
                    might “replace attending office hours or completing readings

                    Such institutional investment aims to democratize access, though not all

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    By mid‑2025, AI is woven into the daily lives of nearly all U.S. college 
                    students—an essential tool for study, writing, and career readiness. Yet this 
                    transformation brings trade‑offs: worries around academic integrity, diminished 
                    creativity, cognitive reliance, and inequity in opportunities. As faculty and 
                    institutions grapple with policy, ethics, and pedagogy, the best forward path 
                    appears to be thoughtful integration—teaching students not only how to use AI, 
                    but when and why, so that it augments human insights rather than substituting 
                    them
                </p>
                <p>
                    The future of higher education hinges on whether AI becomes the scaffold 
                    students learn upon… or the crutch they lean on
